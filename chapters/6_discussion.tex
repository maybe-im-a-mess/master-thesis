\chapter{Discussion and future work}

This chapter will provide an interpretation of the results presented in Chapter 5, discussing their implications for the development of medical chatbots and the broader field of conversational AI. It will also address the limitations of the current study and propose directions for future research to further enhance the capabilities and reliability of LLM-based chatbots in healthcare settings.
