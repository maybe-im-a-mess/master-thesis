The challenges in ensuring LLMs extract correct information and communicate it effectively without hallucination or omitting critical details.

\section{Research Objectives}

TODO:
Outline the goals (benchmarking IE approaches, simulating patient-doctor interactions, and evaluating communication quality).

\section{Thesis outline}

TODO:
Briefly describe the content of each chapter, highlighting how they contribute to addressing the research objectives and solving the problem statement.
